What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

Population | Total:1000	Vaccinated Percentage: 0.2
Virus | Name: H1N1	Mortality Rate: 0.6	Reproductive Rate: 0.1

What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?

10% or 100 people were infected

What percentage of the population died from the virus?

50% or 500 people died

Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?

There were 29096 interactions between a sick person and a vaccinated person.
